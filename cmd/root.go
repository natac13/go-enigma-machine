	Use:   "go-enigma-machine",
	Short: "A simple enigma machine simulator written in Go.",
	Long: `An Enigma machine simulator written in Go.

By default, the machine is configure with the following settings:

- Rotors: III, II, I
- Rotor positions: AAA
- Rotor ring settings: AAA
- Reflector: B
- Plugboard: None

You can change these settings by creating a configuration file in your home directory
named .go-enigma-machine.yaml. The file should look like this:

rotors:
	- III // Leftmost rotor or first rotor
	- II
	- I // Rightmost rotor or last rotor
rotor-positions: AAA
rotor-ring-settings: AAA
reflector: B
plugboard:
	pairs:
		- AB
		- CD
		- EF
		
The rotors names can be I, II, III, IV, or V. The reflector names can be A, B, or C.
The plugboard pairs can be any two letters from A to Z. Without duplicates.

The machine will use the first rotor in the list as the rightmost rotor, the second rotor
as the middle rotor, and the third rotor as the leftmost rotor. The reflector and plugboard
settings will be used as is.

There are flags to set the rotors, reflector, plugboard pairs, and rotor positions from
the command line. Run go-enigma-machine --help for more information.
